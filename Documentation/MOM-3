*VENUE: Lab for Spatial Informatics
*DATE: 16th December, 2016.
*TIME: 11:00 PM
*MEMBERS PRESENT: Srishti Srivastav, Aaksash Mittal, Soumya Vadlamannati


ACTIVITIES
*Explained Rahul's code to Aakash, for implementing with dxf data.
*Decided to shift my work to gml conversion, since shp file generation was not consistent(not every file had an ID layer and hence Rahul's code worked only on 1 file, giving errors for the rest).
*Disucussed specifics of the algortithm being implemented by Aakash.
